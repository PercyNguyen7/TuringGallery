# Turing Gallery

## Gameplay
[Discover the Turing Gallery](https://turinggallery.netlify.app/)
The web application introduces their users to an infinite series of recent AI/Human artworks drawn from Reddit. Once the user finished classifying an artwork, the artwork's author and all relevant information will be revealed under the results section. 

## Purpose
The Turing Gallery arms its players with a critical mind and a skeptical eye against artificially generated content.
Amidst the era of (mis)information, the inability to distinguish the real from the artificial may pervert one's truth and reality.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Development

### 1. Tools
Design: originally designed and assembled in Figma, with icons chosen from the [Iconify Figma plugin](https://iconify.design/). 
Development: Built with React.JS, Node.JS, Javascript and styled with TailwindCSS

### 2. Challenges
#### 1. 1000 Listings Limitation of Reddit API
**Challenge:** 
To avoid pulling the same information every time, I used the `after` query to fetch the next batch of artworks. However, the API call eventually reach the 1000 listings limit and return no data.   

**Solution:** 
To make this gallery seemingly infinite, the Turing Gallery will fetch restart the fetch from the beginning which does may however render previously viewed artworks.  

**Challenge:** Data Variance - There are two layers of variance for each Reddit post:

1. **Subreddit Variance**  
   Each subreddit tends to have its own posting traits. This makes navigating between subreddits time-consuming and demanding careful handling.

2. **Individual Post Variance**  
   Within any subreddit, each post is unique and possesses different attributes, requiring flexible handling.

**Solution:**  
Dynamic Post Classification & Rendering
 * To address the variance in data, posts are dynamically classified into images or videos.

   #### üñºÔ∏è Images
   Most image posts from Reddit contain the `post_hint` attribute with a value of `"image"`.
   When this is detected, the Gallery renders the **Image** component.

   #### üé• Videos
   Videos are more complex, often falling into subcategories. Two useful classifications are:

- **Reddit-Hosted Videos**
   These videos do not contains audios, and while it easy easy to host them locally (via their `fallback_url` tag), I had to retrieve their audio manually, hide it, then synergize it to play whenever the user clicks on a video.
  
- **Non-Reddit-Hosted Videos**
   Due to majority of video embeds being from youtube, I create a YoutubeEmbed component which contains the embed code with the appropriate source. Even finding the youtube video's ID is difficult, as each subreddit data never contains the embed source, but rather contains a youtube link with the youtube ID. This YouTube ID is then deduced from various sources

   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rt_O5FJcK10, https://www.youtube.com/shorts/PwSOZli5_xg, or https://youtu.be/4nrl1PNYkYQ.


### 3. Future Development
#### In the foreseeable future, the Gallery will include a login system for users to store their point as well as their gameplay history.
